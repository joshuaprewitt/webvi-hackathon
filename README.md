Install the ni-skyline-labview-tag-http-src-1_1.0.0.3_windows_x64.nipkg package by downloading and double-clicking on it.  It will add an HTTP Tag API under Data Communications in NXG 2.0.

The Web Application Project is a very simple project that uses the Tag HTTP API to read a tag from a SystemLink server.

The Temp Logger Web Application is a more advanced application that uses the lower-level HTTP primitives to read multiple tags and can send a Skyline Message to the target to trigger it to upload a file to the server.
